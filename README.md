# DerpyEngine

The beginnings of a game engine, inspired by TheCherno. This project was started simply as a platform to expand my knowledge on the workings of game engines, learn about new technologies and being able to directly try implementing them. Also a project to get myself to tackle big projects and practice structured and high-performance programming.
